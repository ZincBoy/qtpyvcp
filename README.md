[![LinuxCNC 2.8][linuxcnc-badge]](https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc)


QtPyVCP is a Qt and Python based framework for building virtual control panels
for the LinuxCNC machine control.

The goal is to provide a no-code, drag-and-drop system for making simple VCPs,
as well as a straightforward, flexible and extensible framework to aid in
building complex VCPs.

## Warning

QtPyVCP master branch is now python 3 only

Requires debian 11

Do I need to install master branch?

Only if you want to use linuxcnc 2.9.0~pre or help porting qtpyvcp to python3

Master branch is our develop channel, we offer stable releases but none yet for Python3,
latest python2 release is 0.3.19

a maintenance branch is keept until linuxcnc 2.9 is released

to install it you need to run

```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/kcjengr/qtpyvcp@python2_maintenance
```



What I need to install?
You may need a linuxcnc 2.9.0~pre or latter
detailed packages requiered for `runtime` or `develop` are mentioned here:
https://www.qtpyvcp.com/install/prerequisites.html

How does affect your VCP?
  You only need to run `2to3.py` in your VCP root directory

In runtime mode how does affect my configs?

Nothing it should be transparent

I have python component
run `2to3.py`in yor component directory

QtPyVCP is developed and tested using the Debian 10 and 11 x64 (buster and bullseye)
[Live ISO](http://linuxcnc.org/downloads/). It should run
on any system that can have PyQt5 installed, but Debian 9 and 10 x64 is the only OS
that is officially supported.
